slim.py: A schema-less, indexed, MySQL-based datastore inspired by FriendFeed [1].

Assumes that all values are stored in a homogenous table "entries" with
a format similar to the following:
 
 CREATE TABLE entities (
    added_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    id VARCHAR(36) NOT NULL,
    updated TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    body MEDIUMBLOB,
    UNIQUE KEY (id),
    KEY (updated)
 ) ENGINE=InnoDB;
 
The "body" field stores pickled, zlib-compressed, standard Python dictionaries with arbitrary contents.

Indexes to this table are stored in seperate tables with a schema like the below:

CREATE TABLE index_user_id (
    user_id VARCHAR(36) NOT NULL,
    entity_id VARCHAR(36) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, entity_id)
) ENGINE=InnoDB;

In this example, the referenced entity would refer to a dictionary with a key "user_id".

This library is still under development and further documentation will follow when released.
